# Halloween

Practicing methods and objects.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:JumpstartLab/halloween.git
```

## Exercise 1

If you'd like to be walked through the exercise, check out the [Objects and Methods](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/academy/workshops/objects_and_methods.html) workshop on the Jumpstart Lab tutorials site.

Check out the exercise-1 branch:

```bash
$ git checkout -t origin/exercise-1
```

Make the tests pass in the following sequence:

* `test/candy_test.rb`
* `test/bag_test.rb`
* `test/costume_test.rb`
* `test/trick_or_treater_test.rb`

Run a test file by calling it with `ruby`:

```bash
$ ruby test/bag_test.rb
```

## Exercise 2

Check out the exercise-2 branch:

```bash
$ git checkout -t origin/exercise-2
```

Each object has become a little bit more complex.

Make the tests pass in the following sequence:

* `test/candy_test.rb`
* `test/bag_test.rb`
* `test/costume_test.rb`
* `test/trick_or_treater_test.rb`
